To-do:

stuff to finish for Wolfi by Wednesday:
- hatching sex ratio analysis (stats and variation)
- double check LTRE and sensitivity analysis (why does ISR have no effect?)

After a thorough assement, I have decided that:
- best to stick with a two-stage, two-sex, one-population matrix model
  - stochastic dispersal between populations made the model chaotic
  - deterministic dispersal between populations made the model the same as the single model

Things to prepare for Wolfi:
- general:
  - figure of Safari's mixed effect sex-specific cox models for both species
  - figure of species- and sex-specific hazard functions
  - figure of mating system

- single season juvenile sex ratio results:
  - model overview
  - figures of survival process:
    1) real N dyanmics from hatch to day 70
    2) sex ratio dynamics from hatch to day 70
  - need to eventually do sensitivity analysis

- two-sex matrix model:
  - model overview
  - figures:
  1) ASR distributions
  2) violin plots
  3) LTRE bar plot
  4) LTRE heatmap
  
Conclusions:
1) ASR bias in BC comes from a post-juvenile phase
2) changes in the ASR are most sensitive female biased mortality
