To-do:

stuff to finish for Wolfi by Wednesday:
- hatching sex ratio analysis (stats and variation)
- double check LTRE and sensitivity analysis (why does ISR have no effect? -> probably because adult survival is equal between sexes in that version of the model)

- sensitivity and LTRE analysis on the single year model
- try extracting sex-specific adult survival of both species from the radio tagging data
- run a model with 50/50 HSR for each species

After a thorough assement, I have decided that:
- best to stick with a two-stage, two-sex, one-population matrix model
  - stochastic dispersal between populations made the model chaotic
  - deterministic dispersal between populations made the model the same as the single model

Things to prepare for Wolfi:
- general:
  - figure of Safari's sex-specific cox models for both species
  - figure of species- and sex-specific hazard functions
  - figure of mating system

- single season juvenile sex ratio results:
  - model overview
  - figures of survival process:
    1) real N dyanmics from hatch to day 70
    2) sex ratio dynamics from hatch to day 70
  - need to eventually do sensitivity analysis

- two-sex matrix model:
  - model overview
  - figures:
  1) ASR distributions
  2) violin plots
  3) LTRE bar plot
  4) LTRE heatmap
  5) Sensitivity analysis line plots
  
Conclusions:
1) ASR bias in BC comes from a post-juvenile phase
2) changes in the ASR are most sensitive female biased mortality

-------------------------
- add (mean, sd) of the above traits to the hazard bootstrap
- re-run completely stochastic model
- tidy up repo
- clean up WBC adult CJS scripts (and wrangle)
