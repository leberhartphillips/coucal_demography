To-do:

stuff to finish for Wolfi by Wednesday:
- hatching sex ratio analysis (stats and variation)
- double check LTRE and sensitivity analysis (why does ISR have no effect? -> probably because adult survival is equal between sexes in that version of the model)

- sensitivity and LTRE analysis on the single year model
- try extracting sex-specific adult survival of both species from the radio tagging data
- run a model with 50/50 HSR for each species

After a thorough assement, I have decided that:
- best to stick with a two-stage, two-sex, one-population matrix model
  - stochastic dispersal between populations made the model chaotic
  - deterministic dispersal between populations made the model the same as the single model

Things to prepare for Wolfi:
- general:
  - figure of Safari's sex-specific cox models for both species
  - figure of species- and sex-specific hazard functions
  - figure of mating system

- single season juvenile sex ratio results:
  - model overview
  - figures of survival process:
    1) real N dyanmics from hatch to day 70
    2) sex ratio dynamics from hatch to day 70
  - need to eventually do sensitivity analysis

- two-sex matrix model:
  - model overview
  - figures:
  1) ASR distributions
  2) violin plots
  3) LTRE bar plot
  4) LTRE heatmap
  5) Sensitivity analysis line plots
  
Conclusions:
1) ASR bias in BC comes from a post-juvenile phase
2) changes in the ASR are most sensitive female biased mortality

got the JSR stochastic model running. Might be best to assume that HSR is 50/50 (see results_JSR_dynamics.R, XX_JSR_run_5050_HSR)
Need to set up a sensitivity analysis of the JSR model

Summary of analytical workflow:
1) scripts to summarise constant rates:
  R/analysis/analysis_egg_survival.R -- binomial glmer of probability of hatching (N: WBC = 213, BC = 271)
  R/analysis/analysis_clutch_size.R -- simple summary of average cluch size (N: WBC = 213, BC = 271)
  R/analysis/analysis_hatching_sex_ratio.R -- binomial glmer of probability of being male (N: WBC = 51, BC = 71)
  R/analysis/analysis_immigration_sex_ratio.R -- simple summary of annual average sex ratio of breeding population (N: WBC = 3, BC = 7)
  R/analysis/analysis_mating_system.R -- simple summary of annual average number of males per female
  R/analysis/analysis_fledge_age.R -- lmer of fledge times by sex and species (rnd = nest_ID and year)
  R/analysis/analysis_age_first_flight_age.R -- lmer of first flight times by sex and species (rnd = nest_ID and year)
  
2) scripts for survival analysis and visualizations:
  R/analysis/analysis_k-m_and_cox_survival_models.R -- Cox proportional hazard tests for sex and species, K-M plots
  R/results/results_hazard_rate.R -- inverted hazard functions for sex and species
  
3) matrix model
  R/analysis/analysis_sensitivity_analysis_JSR.R
  R/analysis/analysis_JSR_bootstrap.R
  R/analysis/analysis_WBC_adult_survival_bootstrap.R
  R/analysis/analysis_age_distribution_plumage.R
  

- add (mean, sd) of the above traits to the hazard bootstrap
- re-run completely stochastic model
- tidy up repo
- clean up WBC adult CJS scripts (and wrangle)

END OF MIQ STATUS
- MS: need to finish up the methods for the LTRE and add the results of the matrix model
      need to add the LTRE results to the main figure
- R: need to rerun the whole bootstrap with the new flight and fledge ages (i.e., based on the predictions of species-specific models)
     Tidy up repo
